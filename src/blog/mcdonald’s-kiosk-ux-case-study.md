McDonald’s aims for a great experience in a hospitable and safe environment, which becomes increasingly more important with the uncertainty of the current state of the global pandemic we all find ourselves in. While I can’t help relieve the uncertainties of life, I did strive to address and solve a small-scale problem within my immediate environment in which maybe I can provide some valuable impact.

I wanted to address and reoccurring problem that would arise too often over my years working at the restaurant, and in turn develop a much faster, easier checkout experience for all our customers.

Although interactive self-checkout processes have been a part of society for many years now and we have all developed a mental model of how the interaction should go. These two aspects of the design were the two main points of pain I found to be causing issues with the current kiosk service system.

This picture was all too frequent, as over the years I have given first-hand support to too many customers experiencing mostly the same issues time and time again during the checkout flow. The confused look for assistance was one I got quite familiar with, and its this customer reaction that was my main motivating factor to address and attempt to solve this issue. 

## Good use of time?

I’m currently trying to learn to program as I have formed a great passion for programming, the web, and all things development.

### So?

So wouldn’t my limited free time outside work be better spent practicing code, doing that new react course I invested in, or reading that new Javascript book that just arrived, and not doing in-depth research into the interaction design of the kiosks in my workplace, well… maybe?

I definitely have a newfound desire to provide value to people through the amazing possibilities of code but I feel like taking a brief step back from coding to delve into UX and the design process will lead me to more thoughtfully researched decisions as I try to progress my skills in solution development.

My approach as a newbie trying to get into the tech industry is to cast a wide net and I dunno maybe become a unicorn.

## So why no survey or questionnaires from your target users?

Well, my goal of this project was to address the hiccups in the immersive experience we provide, and I felt the actions of approaching customers during their visit and bombarding them with questions about their goals and needs would greatly affect some customers experiences. Speaking for myself here the last thing I want is someone approaching me with 20 questions as I try to enjoy my food in public. I felt my genuine interactions with customers over the years were enough user research to begin to define, ideate, and prototype the problem solution.

Really though, I just didn’t want to annoy people going about their business.

## Takeaways

I definitely feel like I solved the main key pain points I set out to address. 
Improvements could very well be made to my overall visual presentation, design, and prototyping of my solutions.
This is an area of design I find super useful and beneficial not just for solving and dissecting UX concerns but also to give developers a more realistic picture of a feature before implementation.

I tried to stay consistent with the current visual design of the system. My idea was to make the implementation of the results of the design process as easily executable as possible. 
I found that the development and production of the key screens/features would fit well in the current information architecture. I believe this was necessary as to not force the business to sink investment in a complete revamp of the overall design of the user interface.

## Questions and feedback.

Feedback would have been advantageous throughout this process to ease some of the creeping imposter syndrome I inevitably experienced during this project.
Who am I to question the design of this expensive interactive technology system designed by professionals?

When the question I’m usually asking is what sauce would you like with your nuggets?...

## The future

The kiosks provide an incredible amount of accessibility features which are ever-increasing as technology continues to progress. I am curious to see the future of the kiosk experience once sufficient testing has been carried out using the ever-growing newer technologies like AR/VR, AI, and Voice recognition, and how the company can craft this advanced tech into the design of their customer experience.

\*Disclaimer: This problem may only be store-specific as I have yet to have any interactions with any other kiosk flows outside of my current workplace. I worked full time at Mcdonald's and had no plan to travel to any store during my free time. My aim was to strengthen my approach towards design thinking and problem solving in general with hopefulness to have a valuable impact on my local environment with my solution to this real-world problem I encountered in my day-to-day work life.
