## My Blog

The goal of this blog is to be open and honest about my journey. I need a place to try to cement the new things that I’m attempting to learn, and hopefully shake my old brass attitude towards learning along the way. Whether it’s code, design, or just life, I plan to have this green dot be the start of an ever-growing digital garden.

The only other option to document my learning publicly would be video and my attempts to sit down and record myself talking into a mic were, well... unsuccessful to say the least.

Writing seems like less of a hurdle, less of a barrier for getting my thoughts out there and I don’t have to hear my own voice, which is always a plus.

## Young & Naive

I never studied going through my average educational path, and this isn’t a brag, I barely passed my way into college. My young arrogance towards learning didn’t fare well in college and dropping out of college was not a highlight of my life.

My only real attempts at ‘study’ involved writing and rewriting lines of a definition if I got it wrong in class when a teacher asked.

I put more importance on video game related learning more than anything truly educational.

Some things that took precedence over schoolwork:

* Game mechanics
* Builds
* Maps
* Talent trees

If it wasn’t whatever flavor of the month game I was engrossed in at the time I wasn’t interested.

My relationship with educational learning was non-existent and it really stunted my progression in life. 

Until I was on the other side of the table.

Getting older and gaining some experience of teaching is what changed my outlook on learning and really solidified that it’s a lifelong effort and not something that can be ignored or left for later. My brief time teaching English in China not only gave me a taste of a completely different culture but it shaped my attitude towards personal learning and development.

## Shaking the fear

Trying to shake the fear of documenting my learning journey has been a challenge. The doubt and cautiousness of putting myself out there publicly had me feeling like I was stuck at the gates of a race that was never going to start.

### So why create content?

I realised it’s only me that can clear that gate, and start the race.

I’m creating to find people with similar interests, similar passions, people to accept who I am, and for me to accept myself too. I want to express my thoughts, decisions, all my failures, and passions so I can find people that feel the same way.

I’m creating content to be open and not hide away from criticism or embarrassment. In order to improve myself in whatever way that continues me along this mountainous journey of life. 

I’m creating to leave my thoughts behind, there’s no need to carry them all to the finish line.
